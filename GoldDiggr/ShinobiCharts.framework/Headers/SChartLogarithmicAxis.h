/** 
 An SChartLogarithmicAxis is a subclass of SChartNumberAxis used for displaying logarithmic data.
 
 Unlike a 'standard' number axis, the distance between n and n+1 is not the same as the distance between n+7 and n+8.
 Rather, the distance between base^(n) and base^(n+1) is the same as the distance between base^(n+7) and base^(n+8).
